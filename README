                                  The Lua markov bot!

This distribution contains:
mm.lua -- the guts: implementation of training, response generation & ranking
dumper.lua -- serializes lua tables
fe.lua -- frontend: everything with file i/o or irc-specific code
ircmode.sh -- connects to irc using epic/ircii
mm.db -- the serialized representation of the current training data

Notes:
ircmode.sh uses dot-files for temporary storage, as a pipe. These are of the
form .$$, where $$ is the PID of the instance of ircmode.sh. These contain the complete log of activity as output by epic in dumb mode. These could get very 
large, and they are not deleted if you kill the bot with a control-c or some
other SIGINT/SIGKILL. So, if you are force-killing the bot frequently and 
you want to save space, periodically clean out stale dotfiles.
