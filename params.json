These are of the form .$$, where $$ is the PID of the instance of ircmode.sh. These contain the complete log of activity as output by epic in dumb mode. These could get very large, and they are not deleted if you kill the bot with a control-c or some other SIGINT/SIGKILL. So, if you are force-killing the bot frequently and you want to save space, periodically clean out stale dotfiles.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"A markov chain bot in lua","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
